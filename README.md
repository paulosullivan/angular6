# My Notes

## Component Based Framework
1. There is a root component.
2. Components can contain other components.
3. Components contain the HTML and the JavaScript.
4. Components get referenced by their name header-section => <header-section>...</header-section>

## Setup

* Download NodeJS (which comes with NPM)  
	* node -v  
	* npm -v  
* Download Angular CLI
	* npm install -g @angular/cli
	* ng -v
* IDE - Java Brains use Visual Studio Code

## New Project

* ng new <project-name>
* ng serve (Run the bare bones app that got created when we called ng new)
* localhost:4200

## New Component

* ng generate component hello-world
* Generates 4 files under a new folder - .html, .css, .ts, .spec.ts
* Updates the app.module.ts file under the root app folder. Adds a new import
* The selector is in the .ts file -> selector: 'app-hello-world'
* ng serve
* Now add the component to app.component.html -> <app-hello-world></app-hello-world>

## Project Struture

* index.html - <app-root></app-root>
* app/app.component.html|css|ts
* app/app.component.spec.ts - for unit testing
* 
*
